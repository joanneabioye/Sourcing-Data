# Sourcing Data

Hypothesis: Has fossil fuel consumption reduced as renewable energy has increased?

For my first portfolio project my objective was to source and combine data that would assist me to answer my question. Has fossil fuel consumption reduced as renewable energy has increased?
Intrigued by renewable energy, I decided to explore the correlation between the rise in renewable energy and the potential reduction in fossil fuel consumption. My project commenced with sourcing relevant datasets on Our World in Data. 

I found the following data sets relevant in answering my question. 
1.	Renewable Energy
https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy 
2.	Fossil Fuels
https://ourworldindata.org/fossil-fuels

Now I had my datasets the next step was to format the CSV files and then migrate the data onto one workbook. Drawing on methods learned in my workshop, I opened both datasets onto one workbook.

The datasets contained data for individual countries, continents and combined data for the world. For this project I decided to base my project on World data as I was intrigued to discover what the datasets would reveal about our world today. Initially I filtered the data on the “Entity” column to display World data only. Both datasets contained equal number of entries - 57 entries starting from 1967 to 2022. This enabled me to merge the data seamlessly utilizing the Vlookup function.

Engaging in this project proved to be incredibly freeing. Applying the skills acquired over the past two weeks, I successfully concluded my initial project. The primary hurdle lay in sourcing relevant datasets. Nonetheless, once I located the right resources, the data was readily available. Merging the datasets was a straightforward task since both contained an equal number of rows. Intrigued by the potential insights, I'm keen to delve deeper and compare data from different countries. This effort would present a more extensive and demanding project, given the vast amounts of data involved.
